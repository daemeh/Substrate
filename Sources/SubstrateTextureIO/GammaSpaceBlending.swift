         Correct:

         blendG = baseG * (1.0 - alpha) + g * alpha
         blendB = baseB * (1.0 - alpha) + b * alpha
         
         We need to find r', g', b', a' such that:
         baseR * (1.0 - a') + r' * a' = linearToSRGB(sRGBToLinear(baseR) * (1.0 - alpha) + sRGBToLinear(r) * alpha)

         If we make r, g, b all 0:
         
         base * (1.0 - a') = linearToSRGB(sRGBToLinear(base) * (1.0 - alpha))
         base - a' * base = linearToSRGB(sRGBToLinear(base) * (1.0 - alpha))
         a' = (base - linearToSRGB(sRGBToLinear(base) * (1.0 - alpha))) / base
         
         If base == 1.0:
         
         a' = 1.0 - linearToSRGB(1.0 - alpha)
         
         Next, find the colour adjustment:
         
         base * (1.0 - a') + r' * a' = linearToSRGB(sRGBToLinear(base) * (1.0 - alpha) + sRGBToLinear(r) * alpha)
         
         If base == 1:
         
         (1.0 - a') + r' * a' = linearToSRGB((1.0 - alpha) + sRGBToLinear(r) * alpha)
         r' = (linearToSRGB((1.0 - alpha) + sRGBToLinear(r) * alpha) - (1.0 - a')) / a'
